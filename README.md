# Linux_and_AWS_Challenges

A series of challenges posted semi-daily to help in learning Linux and AWS.  The challenges are semi-real,
based of problems that happen in the field.  They are made up in that there are often better enterprise solutions, 
but the focus here is on learning some technique or specific process.

Enjoy!
